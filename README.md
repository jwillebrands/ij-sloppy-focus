This plugin brings sloppy focus to your favorite IDE.
<!-- Plugin description end -->

## Functionality

Sloppy Focus currently supports editor windows only. If you would like another type of window to be supported, please create
a [feature request](https://github.com/jwillebrands/ij-sloppy-focus/issues).

**Note:** This plugin is still in a very early phase. It 'works on my machine', but has not yet seen much use and has not been
tested properly. There will be bugs and rough edges. Please feel free to create bug reports for usability or compatibility issues.

## Installation

This plugin is provided both as a regular IDE plugin, and as a Flora micro-plugin script.
Feature parity will be maintained as long as it is feasible to do so.
